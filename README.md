# Federated-Learning-with-Homomorphic-Encryption
A novel approach called FedHEONN combines federated learning (FL) and homomorphic encryption (HE) for one-layer neural networks. Unlike conventional FL methods that necessitate multiple training rounds for convergence, our method achieves a collaborative global model in just one training round. This results in an efficient and effective model, simplifying the FL training process. Moreover, the inclusion of homomorphic encryption in our approach enhances its resilience against model inversion attacks.
